# What Animal Am I Quiz

### This quiz was built to showcase my knowledge of vue.js and rendering data through it. It is a project for Christine Bittle's Trends in Web Development course.

## What I've done

- Binded classes and styles to objects
- Dynamically rendered each question and its associated answers via for loops

## What I've Learned Independently
- Learned how to display a singular object in an array at a time via its index
- Having a previous button only show up if it the index is greater than the inital index of 0
- Creating more than one object at a time

## What I'd like to achieve in the future

- Currently the quiz is not allowing a user to only select one answer at a time and I'd like to change that
- I would like to have a tally at the end of the quiz of how many answers the user got right or wrong
